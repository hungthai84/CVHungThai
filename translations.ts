      "I am Nguyen Hung Thai, currently serving as the Head of Customer Service – a quiet companion in every moment the business touches the customer's heart.",
      "I began my career in Customer Service in 2002 – when call center agents still recorded tickets in Excel and \"customer service\" was simply... listen - record - respond.",
      "20 years later, I have worked in various environments – from telecommunications, e-commerce, insurance, finance, gaming, to technology – each place teaching me a new perspective on what truly makes a memorable experience.",
      "From Mobifone to Shopee, from Garena to Momo, Prudential, Finviet wallet, and now – I don't just take care of customers; I build systems so that everyone on the team can take care of customers better than I can.",
      "What makes me love this job is not just the thank-yous, but the lessons from dissatisfied customers.",
      "I always believe:\n👉 A good process is just the starting point.\n👉 A dedicated team is the real strength.\n👉 And technology – if applied at the right time, in the right place – can expand trust, not just automate.",
      "Therefore, I spend a lot of time building CRM systems, data dashboards, AI chatbots... but more importantly, training the team to listen carefully – understand deeply – handle delicately.",
      "On the journey ahead, I don't just want customers to “not complain,” but to proactively recommend the business to others.\nI don't just want the team to do things right, but to feel proud of every problem they solve.\nAnd I believe: future customer care will not only be in the call center but will appear at every touchpoint – every department – every interaction.",
      "I am here not just to tell a success story, but to write a new chapter for the customer experience with you – where service is a deep connection, not just a timely response.",
      "I am Nguyen Hung Thai – and this journey is still ongoing. Every message, every minute of listening, every small change in the system, is a step in a great journey: turning customers into sustainable companions.",
      "Thank you for listening."

                "The biggest challenge was not choosing a technology platform, but how to seamlessly integrate data from countless touchpoints - from the app, website, call center, social media, to partners - into a single source of truth. We needed a system that not only stored information but also had the ability to analyze, forecast, and provide real-time action suggestions.",
                "The project was divided into 4 main phases: (1) Survey and Requirements Analysis, (2) Vendor and Platform Selection, (3) Implementation and Integration, (4) Training and Optimization. I worked directly with departments from Product, Marketing, to Operations to ensure the CRM system met everyone's needs while always placing the customer at the center.",

We needed a system that balanced operational efficiency with the strategic goal of enhancing customer loyalty and lifetime value.",
                "We adopted the OKR (Objectives and Key Results) framework. Our Objectives were ambitious and qualitative, such as 'Create a frictionless support experience.' The Key Results were measurable outcomes, like 'Improve Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) score from 85% to 90%' or 'Reduce customer effort score (CES) by 15%.' These were supported by traditional KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) like First Contact Resolution (FCR) and Average Handling Time (AHT) to monitor operational health.",

                "The main obstacle was internal silos. Each department (Marketing, Sales, Product, CS) had a piece of the puzzle, but no one had the complete picture. This resulted in a fragmented and sometimes contradictory experience for our customers.",
                "I spearheaded a series of cross-functional workshops involving stakeholders from all key departments. We used a combination of data analysis (from CRM and analytics tools) and qualitative feedback (customer interviews, surveys, support tickets) to build a comprehensive Customer Journey Map. This visual map detailed the customer's actions, thoughts, and feelings at each stage, from initial awareness to long-term loyalty.",

It exposed critical pain points we hadn't been aware of, such as a confusing onboarding process and a disconnect between marketing promises and product reality. The map provided a shared blueprint for improvement, leading to a 20% reduction in onboarding-related support tickets and a measurable uplift in user retention."

All departmental tasks, from updating a help article to investigating a recurring bug, were added as cards. This provided an immediate, shared view of all work. We also instituted brief daily 'stand-up' meetings to discuss progress and roadblocks.",

The team's productivity increased by an estimated 25%, and the time to implement process improvements was cut in half.

First, we implemented a robust tagging system in our CRM, allowing agents to categorize every interaction by feature request, bug report, or user confusion point. Second, I initiated a bi-weekly 'VoC Insights' meeting, where CS leadership presented a data-driven report to the Product team, highlighting trends, top issues, and direct customer quotes. A shared dashboard visualized this data in real-time.",

Most importantly, it established a baseline for quality, allowing us to coach and evaluate performance more effectively."

                "Today's customers expect to interact with a business on their own terms, switching between channels like email, chat, and phone calls effortlessly. This project was about breaking down the walls between our support channels to create a single, unified conversation with each customer.",
                "The core problem was a disjointed experience. A customer might start a conversation via live chat, follow up with an email, and then call us, having to repeat their issue every single time. This was a major source of customer frustration and internal inefficiency.",
                "We architected and implemented a true omnichannel support solution. This involved migrating from separate tools to an integrated helpdesk platform that consolidated all customer interactions—whether from phone, email, social media, or live chat—into a single, chronological thread. Now, any agent could instantly see the customer's entire history, regardless of the channel used.",
                "The shift to omnichannel was a game-changer. It dramatically reduced the effort required from our customers, a key driver of loyalty. Our CSAT scores saw a significant lift, with many customers positively commenting on the seamless experience. Internally, agent productivity increased as they no longer needed to switch between multiple systems to piece together a customer's history."

                "Our agents were spending a significant portion of their day on manual tasks: copying and pasting data between systems, categorizing tickets, and sending formulaic responses. This was not only inefficient but also led to burnout and took time away from genuine customer engagement.",
                "We took a strategic approach to automation. We started by analyzing our ticket data to identify the most frequent and time-consuming repetitive tasks. We then implemented a series of automations using our helpdesk's built-in workflows and Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools. This included auto-triaging and routing of new tickets, automated responses for common questions, and macros that allowed agents to perform multi-step processes with a single click.",
                "By automating over 30% of our manual tasks, we reclaimed thousands of hours of agent time per month. This allowed us to handle a higher volume of inquiries without increasing headcount and, more importantly, enabled our agents to dedicate more time to resolving complex customer issues, leading to more meaningful and satisfactory resolutions."

This project involved developing and managing targeted outbound campaigns to engage customers at key moments in their lifecycle, preventing issues before they arise and fostering deeper relationships.",
                "Our communication with customers was almost entirely reactive. We waited for them to contact us with a problem. This meant we were missing opportunities to onboard new users effectively, gather feedback from long-term customers, or re-engage those who had become inactive.",
                "We developed a series of data-driven outbound campaigns. This included: personalized welcome calls to new high-value customers, proactive check-ins for users who encountered a known bug, satisfaction survey calls after a major interaction, and campaigns to re-engage dormant users with new feature information. We created detailed scripts and guidelines to ensure these interactions were helpful and value-adding, not intrusive.",
                "Our proactive approach was highly successful. The welcome call campaign increased initial product adoption by 25% for targeted users. The feedback campaigns provided rich qualitative data for our product team. Overall, these campaigns shifted the perception of our CS department from a problem-solving center to a proactive partner in our customers' success."

                "Our data was scattered across multiple systems (helpdesk, call system, survey tools), and reporting was a manual, time-consuming process done weekly. This meant we were often slow to react to emerging trends, and the team lacked immediate visibility into their performance.",
                "I worked with our data analyst to connect our various data sources to a Business Intelligence (BI) tool. We designed a comprehensive dashboard with multiple views. The main view provided a high-level overview for leadership, tracking key metrics like CSAT, NPS, ticket volume, and resolution times over time. We also created team-specific views that allowed managers to monitor their team's performance, and even individual agent views to help them track their own progress against goals.",
                "The real-time dashboard revolutionized our operations. We could spot and address negative trends in hours instead of weeks. Gamification elements on the team dashboards boosted motivation and healthy competition. Most importantly, it democratized data, fostering a culture of accountability and data-driven decision-making throughout the entire department."

There was no formal process for following up with customers who left negative feedback, which is a massive missed opportunity.",
                "We implemented an automated post-interaction survey system. Immediately after a ticket was resolved, customers received a simple one-question survey (CSAT or CES) via email or chat, with an optional field for comments. All responses were fed directly back into our CRM and linked to the specific ticket and agent. We created a workflow that automatically flagged all negative reviews and created a follow-up task for a team lead to personally contact the customer within 24 hours.",
                "This 'closed-loop' feedback system had a profound impact. Our survey response rate tripled. We were able to identify and address agent training needs more effectively. The practice of following up on negative feedback allowed us to turn many dissatisfied customers into loyal advocates, demonstrating that we genuinely cared about their experience."

Tôi đã làm việc trực tiếp với các phòng ban từ Sản phẩm, Marketing, đến Vận hành để đảm bảo hệ thống CRM đáp ứng nhu cầu của mọi người trong khi luôn đặt khách hàng làm trung tâm.",

Nhìn chung, các chiến dịch này đã thay đổi nhận thức về phòng CSKH của chúng tôi từ một trung tâm giải quyết vấn đề thành một đối tác chủ động trong sự thành công của khách hàng."

                "Trong dịch vụ khách hàng, bạn không thể cải thiện những gì bạn không thể đo lường. Dự án này tập trung vào việc tập trung các chỉ số chính của chúng tôi vào một dashboard duy nhất, thời gian thực, trao quyền cho mọi thành viên của đội, từ các nhân viên tuyến đầu đến lãnh đạo cấp cao, với những hiểu biết có thể hành động được.",
                "Dữ liệu của chúng tôi bị phân tán trên nhiều hệ thống (helpdesk, hệ thống cuộc gọi, công cụ khảo sát), và việc báo cáo là một quy trình thủ công, tốn thời gian được thực hiện hàng tuần. Điều này có nghĩa là chúng tôi thường chậm phản ứng với các xu hướng mới nổi, và đội ngũ thiếu tầm nhìn tức thì về hiệu suất của họ.",
                "Tôi đã làm việc với nhà phân tích dữ liệu của chúng tôi để kết nối các nguồn dữ liệu khác nhau của chúng tôi với một công cụ Business Intelligence (BI). Chúng tôi đã thiết kế một dashboard toàn diện với nhiều chế độ xem. Chế độ xem chính cung cấp một cái nhìn tổng quan cấp cao cho lãnh đạo, theo dõi các chỉ số chính như CSAT, NPS, khối lượng ticket, và thời gian giải quyết theo thời gian. Chúng tôi cũng đã tạo ra các chế độ xem dành riêng cho từng đội cho phép các quản lý theo dõi hiệu suất của đội họ, và thậm chí cả các chế độ xem cá nhân của nhân viên để giúp họ theo dõi tiến trình của chính mình so với các mục tiêu.",
                "Dashboard thời gian thực đã cách mạng hóa hoạt động của chúng tôi. Chúng tôi có thể phát hiện và giải quyết các xu hướng tiêu cực trong vài giờ thay vì vài tuần. Các yếu tố trò chơi hóa trên dashboard của các đội đã thúc đẩy động lực và sự cạnh tranh lành mạnh. Quan trọng nhất, nó đã dân chủ hóa dữ liệu, nuôi dưỡng một văn hóa trách nhiệm giải trình và ra quyết định dựa trên dữ liệu trong toàn bộ phòng ban."

                "Quy trình khảo sát trước đây của chúng tôi là tùy hứng và thủ công. Tỷ lệ phản hồi thấp, và phản hồi định tính mà chúng tôi nhận được rất khó để phân tích ở quy mô lớn. Không có quy trình chính thức để theo dõi những khách hàng đã để lại phản hồi tiêu cực, đó là một cơ hội bị bỏ lỡ rất lớn.",
                "Chúng tôi đã triển khai một hệ thống khảo sát sau tương tác tự động. Ngay sau khi một ticket được giải quyết, khách hàng nhận được một cuộc khảo sát một câu hỏi đơn giản (CSAT hoặc CES) qua email hoặc chat, với một trường tùy chọn để bình luận. Tất cả các phản hồi được đưa trực tiếp trở lại CRM của chúng tôi và được liên kết với ticket và nhân viên cụ thể. Chúng tôi đã tạo ra một quy trình công việc tự động gắn cờ tất cả các đánh giá tiêu cực và tạo ra một nhiệm vụ theo dõi cho một trưởng nhóm để liên hệ cá nhân với khách hàng trong vòng 24 giờ.",
                "Hệ thống phản hồi 'vòng lặp khép kín' này đã có một tác động sâu sắc. Tỷ lệ phản hồi khảo sát của chúng tôi đã tăng gấp ba. Chúng tôi đã có thể xác định và giải quyết các nhu cầu đào tạo của nhân viên hiệu quả hơn. Việc theo dõi các phản hồi tiêu cực đã cho phép chúng tôi biến nhiều khách hàng không hài lòng thành những người ủng hộ trung thành, chứng tỏ rằng chúng tôi thực sự quan tâm đến trải nghiệm của họ."
